# PeopleMusic - Marketing Brief

**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** MVP Complete, Ready for Rollout

---

## What It Is

PeopleMusic is a public database that tracks whether music artists are human or AI-generated. Think "verified checkmark" but for proving you're a real person making real music.

**The tagline:** *Is This Artist Human or AI?*

---

## Why It Matters Now

- **AI music is flooding streaming platforms.** Spotify removed 75M+ "spammy" tracks last year. Deezer gets 50,000 AI-generated uploads daily.
- **Listeners can't tell the difference.** 97% of people can't distinguish AI from human music (Deezer study).
- **AI artists are charting.** Multiple AI-generated songs hit Billboard charts in 2025—including #1 Country.
- **Artists are getting ripped off.** Fake "ghost artists" and AI clones steal playlist spots and royalties from real musicians.

**Nobody is tracking this.** No central authority exists to verify artist authenticity. We're building it.

---

## What We Have

### The Database
- **1,000+ artists** cataloged
- **921 confirmed human** (legacy artists, pre-2020)
- **79 AI/suspected AI** (researched, documented)
- Searchable, filterable, shareable artist pages

### Verification Statuses
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Confirmed Human | Verified through evidence or pre-2020 policy |
| ⚠️ Suspected AI | Flagged by patterns/analysis, not proven |
| 🔴 Confirmed AI | Admitted or proven AI-generated |
| ❓ Unverified | In database, not yet assessed |

### The Evidence
Every AI artist entry includes documented evidence:
- Billboard chart positions
- Technical analysis (Suno/Udio detection)
- Missing social presence, fake bios
- Industry exposés and news sources

---

## The Opportunity

### For Artists
- **Claim your page** → Prove you're human → Get a verification badge
- Embed badge on website, socials, Linktree
- Stand out as authentically human

### For Fans
- Search any artist before streaming
- Know if you're supporting a human or a machine
- Make informed listening choices

### For the Industry
- API access to query artist status
- Playlist curators can verify before adding

---

## Positioning

### We Are:
- The authoritative source for artist verification
- Pro-transparency, not anti-AI
- Building the "blue check" for music authenticity

### We Are Not:
- Anti-technology or Luddite
- Trying to ban AI music
- A streaming platform or label

### The Frame:
> "AI music isn't going away. But listeners deserve to know what they're hearing. PeopleMusic brings transparency to streaming."

---

## Rollout Strategy (Suggested)

### Phase 1: Awareness
- Launch site publicly
- Seed social with controversial AI artist exposés
- "Did you know this #1 song was made by AI?"
- Target music Twitter/X, industry publications

### Phase 2: Artist Adoption
- Reach out to indie artists for verification
- "Get your PeopleMusic badge"
- Partner with artist communities, unions, collectives

### Phase 3: Platform Integration
- Browser extension (flags AI on Spotify/Apple Music)
- API for playlist curators
- "PeopleMusic Verified" playlist criteria

## Key Messages

**For Press:**
> "PeopleMusic is the first public database tracking whether music artists are human or AI-generated. With AI songs now charting on Billboard and streaming platforms overwhelmed by synthetic content, we're building the transparency layer the music industry needs."

**For Artists:**
> "Prove you're human. Get verified. Stand out."

**For Fans:**
> "Know who you're listening to."

## Assets Ready

- ✅ Public website (localhost → Vercel deploy ready)
- ✅ 1,000+ artist database
- ✅ 79 documented AI artists with evidence
- ✅ Search, filter, artist pages
- ✅ Submission form for public tips
- 🔜 Artist self-verification flow (designed, not built)
- 🔜 Embeddable badges

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Nobody else is doing this.**

- Spotify/Apple: Not disclosing AI, no verification system
- Deezer: Tagging AI content but not public database
- Labels: No transparency incentive
- Journalists: One-off exposés, no persistent tracking

**We become the source of truth.**

---

## First Moves

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (today)
2. **Announce on socials** with 3-5 juicy AI artist exposés
3. **Pitch to music press** (Billboard, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork)
4. **Invite 10 indie artists** to be founding verified members
